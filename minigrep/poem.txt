Miya, my love, my heart's delight,
A precious gem in my life so bright,
Your beauty radiates like the sun,
And my love for you, it cannot be undone.

Your smile, a charm that lights up my day,
And your laughter, a melody that I always play,
In your eyes, I see the stars shining bright,
And being with you feels so very right.

Every moment with you is like a dream,
A perfect picture, a flawless scene,
Your love has transformed my life,
And made it into something so very nice.

Miya, my love, my heart beats for you,
And my soul sings a song that's so true,
You are the one that I adore,
My love for you, forevermore.
